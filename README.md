# birdvision

This repository contains work for my computer vision project, BirdVision. The goal of this project is to create an image classifier capable of identifying birds based on their species, as well as uniquely identify different birds within a species. 

# First Species Classifier
I've started by using code from a PyTorch Finetuning tutorial to finetune the Resnet-18 Deep Learning Image Recognition model on a dataset of 200 species of birds.
